# Otter Launcher

Otter-launcher is a highly extendable cli program that can launch shell scripts or arbitrary commands by a few key strokes. It is customizable with ascii colorcode, sixel or kitty image protocol, and hence a good companion to keyboard-centric window manager users.

The concept is making behaviours like the below possible:

- type "gg margaret thatcher" to google the lady
- type "sh htop" to run htop in a terminal
- type "dc linux" to search the word linux with an online dictionary
- type "app" to launch sway-launcher-desktop
- etc.

It is recommended to use otter-launcher with sway-launcher-desktop, making it an application launcher.

# Features

- modularized prefixes to run different commands (via configuration)
- fuzzy search and tab completion for configured modules
- url encoding for web searching use
- decorated with ascii color codes, chafa, neofetch, etc.
- minimalist, keyboard-centric design

# Installation

## Building from source

```
git clone https://github.com/kuokuo123/otter-launcher /tmp/otter-launcher
cd /tmp/otter-launcher
cargo build --release
sudo cp /tmp/otter-launcher/target/release/otter-launcher /usr/bin/
```

# Configuration

Otter-launcher read a config file from $HOME/.config/otter-launcher/config.toml. If that file is missing, it looks into /etc/otter-launcher/config.toml

``` toml
[general]
default_module = "gg" # The module to run when no prefix is matched; leaving the option empty defaults to googling
empty_module = "" # The module to run with an empty prompt
exec_cmd = "swaymsg exec" # The exec command of your window manager; change it to "hyprctl exec" if you use hyprland
show_suggestion = true # Fuzzy search for prefixes; autocompletion with TAB


[interface]
# ASCII color codes are allowed with these options. However, \x1b[ should be replaced with \u001B[ (unicode escape) because the rust toml crate cannot read \x as an escaped character...
header_cmd = "" # Run a shell command and make the stdout printed above the header
header_cmd_trimmed_lines = 0 # Remove a number of lines from header_cmd output, in case of some programs printing excessive empty lines at the end of its output
header = ""

with_argument = true # If "with_argument" is true, the {} in the cmd value will be replaced with user input. For example, entering "sh yazi ~/downloads" will open yazi and enter the download folder when "with_argument" is true; but will not enter ~/downloads when "with_arguement" is false.
url_encode = true # The url_encode option should be set true when the module is set to call for webpages, as it will make sure special characters in the url being readable to web browsers. It will better be false when the module calls a shell script.
